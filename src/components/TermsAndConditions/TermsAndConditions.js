      <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions
      concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
      concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to,
      or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim
      for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will
      elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
      unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts
      listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
            court.</span></p>
